## 🧾 PSEUDO CUSTOMER – Pseudo Labeling for Customer Segmentation

This project applies **pseudo labeling** (a semi-supervised learning technique) to customer data for classification or segmentation tasks. It combines labeled and pseudo-labeled samples to improve model performance where labeled data is limited.

### 🧠 Key Features
- Pseudo labeling using predictions on unlabeled customer data  
- Classification or segmentation model using Keras  
- Data preprocessing, training, and re-training in one notebook  
- Accuracy and loss visualization  
- Ideal for marketing, churn prediction, or customer analytics  

### 📁 File
- `PSEUDO CUSTOMER.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with the complete semi-supervised workflow

### ✅ Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
